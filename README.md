## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

The biggest challenge I faced was getting the files to upload and make the gif. I am used to working with a code editor and git so this was different for me. The other challenge in this fun exercise was getting used to XCode for the first time and locating where some of the buttons and controls were located.
